        <div class="bg-slate-100 p-4 text-left my-4">
          <p class="">
            JavaScript variables' scope defines where they are accessible and
            where they are not. A variable's scope can be divided into three
            categories: global scope, function scope, and block scope. Depending
            on whether you use var, let, or const, a variable behaves
            differently.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4 bg-white p-2">var :</h2>
          <ul>
            <li class="mt-4">
              <span class="text-lg font-semibold">1.</span> Variables declared
              with var have function scope or global scope but not block scope.
              This indicates that they are usable inside the scope of the stated
              function or the entirety of the global context.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-4">
              <span class="text-lg font-semibold">2.</span> When a var variable
              is declared inside a function, it cannot be accessed from outside
              that function.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-4">
              <span class="text-lg font-semibold">3.</span> Anywhere in the
              script can access a var variable if it is declared outside of any
              function.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-4">
              <span class="text-lg font-semibold">4.</span> Var variables can be
              used before they are declared since they are hoisted to the top of
              their scope (but their value won't be known until it is assigned).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 bg-white p-2">let :</h2>
          <ul>
            <li class="mt-4">
              <span class="text-lg font-semibold">1.</span> Let variables have
              block scope. They are only available within the declaration block.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-4">
              <span class="text-lg font-semibold">2.</span> Let variables,
              unlike var, are not hoisted to the top of their scope, therefore
              they cannot be used before they are defined.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-4">
              <span class="text-lg font-semibold">3.</span> You will get a
              syntax error if you define a let variable with the same name in
              the same scope.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 bg-white p-2">const :</h2>
          <ul>
            <li class="mt-4">
              <span class="text-lg font-semibold">1.</span> Like let, variables declared with const also have block scope.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-4">
              <span class="text-lg font-semibold">2.</span> The main distinction is that once const variables are declared, they must have a value assigned to them since once that value is assigned, it cannot be changed. However, properties or elements for objects and arrays can still be changed.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-4">
              <span class="text-lg font-semibold">3.</span>  Similar to let, const variables are only usable within the block in which they are declared and are not elevated to the top of their scope.
